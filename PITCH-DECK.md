## Slide 2: The Problem

### What Your Clients Are Experiencing:
❌ **Outdated Communication**
- Calling control room takes time
- Hard to explain exact location
- No way to track response

❌ **Limited Visibility**
- Clients don't know if help is coming
- No ETA information
- No incident history

❌ **Competitive Disadvantage**

## Slide 3: The Solution

## Slide 4: How It Works

### Simple 3-Step Process:

1. **Client Presses Button**
   - Chooses emergency type
   - GPS location captured
   - Incident created

2. **Control Room Notified**
   - Instant alert on dashboard
   - See client details & location
   - Dispatch unit via radio (as usual)

3. **Client Gets Updates**
