  HOW TO START YOUR ABC SECURITY APPS - SIMPLE GUIDE
================================================================================

There are 2 files you can use:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. START-APPS.bat
   (Use this for TESTING ON YOUR PC ONLY)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   How to use:
   - Double-click "START-APPS.bat"
   - 2 black windows will open (these are the servers - DON'T CLOSE THEM!)
   - Your browser will open with both apps

   URLs:
   - Client App: http://localhost:8080
   - Security Portal: http://localhost:8081


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. START-APPS-WITH-NGROK.bat
   (Use this for TESTING ON YOUR PHONE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   How to use:
   - Double-click "START-APPS-WITH-NGROK.bat"
   - 4 windows will open (DON'T CLOSE ANY OF THEM!)
   - Look at the 2 ngrok windows
   - Each ngrok window will show a URL like: https://xxxx-xx-xxx.ngrok-free.app

   Finding the URLs:
   - In each ngrok window, look for the line that says:
     "Forwarding    https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8080"
   - Copy that https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app URL
   - One ngrok window is for the Client App (port 8080)
   - One ngrok window is for the Security Portal (port 8081)

   On your phone:
   - Open your phone browser
   - Type/paste the ngrok URL
   - Done! Your app will load

   IMPORTANT:
   - The ngrok URLs are DIFFERENT every time you restart
   - You need to copy the new URLs each time
   - Keep all the black windows open while testing


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO STOP THE APPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   - Just close all the black windows
   - That's it!
